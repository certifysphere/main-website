# Basics of Markdown
Markdown is the most popular markup language that can be used to format documents. It can be used to create *websites*,*ebooks*,*email*,*chats in discussions forums*.

## Topics
1. Paragraphs 

    MD expects a full line space to show texts in a different line else it joins text in the same line.
2.  Text decorations

    MD can write **bold** texts, ~~italiic~~ *italic*  texts
3. Headings
    No of #'s represent the type of heading. Github will automatically add id's to headings, so the text will be automatically linked. 
    ## This is h2
    ### This is h3
4. Links

   [My Github](https://github.com/bhupendra1011 "all repos") account.[Bhupendra][1] github repo.

5. Images
    Images can be used just like links. ![Alt txt](img url)

    !["cat Img"](http://placekitten.com/200/200)

    Thumbnails images can also be used which links to larger image 
    [<img src="http://placekitten.com/20/20">](http://placekitten.com/200/200)


6. Ordered and Unordered Lists

    Coding Best Practices:

    * Keep code DRY
    * Writing Unit Test cases
    * Checking cross-browser support

    Steps to merge branch:

    1. Create a branch from feature
    1. commit your changes
    1. push your changes
    1. raise a pull request

7. Code Blocks

    This is super helpful when posting any code snippet


    ```js
    const fn = () => alert("some fn");
    ```




    ```css
    .hide {
        display:none
    }
    ```


    Also can show code difference


    ```diff
    var x = 10;
    - const counter = 0;
    + let counter = 0
    ```



8. Tables 

    Tables can be generated with headings and text alignment option

    |Stocks|Price|
    |:-----:|------:|
    |TCS|230|
    |YES Bank|500|

# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
