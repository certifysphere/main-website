### Introduction
In today's rapidly evolving world, each generation brings forth its unique set of values, behaviors, and attitudes. The term "Generation Z" has been buzzing around, but what exactly does it mean and why is the current generation referred to as such?

### Body
Generation Z, often abbreviated as Gen Z, typically includes individuals born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s. This generation is characterized by its deep connection to technology, having grown up in a digital age where smartphones and social media are ubiquitous. They are known for their tech-savviness, entrepreneurial spirit, and commitment to social causes.

One of the main reasons why the current generation is labeled as Generation Z is due to the idea of a generational shift. As each generation comes of age, there are changes in societal norms, cultural influences, and economic landscapes. Generation Z follows the millennials and precedes whatever the next generation will be called. This labeling helps us understand the distinct traits and experiences that shape this cohort.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the term "Generation Z" encapsulates the unique characteristics and traits of the current generation. Understanding why they are called so sheds light on their impact on society, economy, and technology. Embracing the differences and nuances of each generation allows us to appreciate the diversity and richness they bring to the world. Generation Z is not just a label but a reflection of the evolving dynamics of our ever-changing world.
